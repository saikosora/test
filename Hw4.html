            <h3>Crescent roll dough – you can use canned crescent roll dough, or sheets of canned crescent dough. Either
                will work, the sheets of dough are simply a little easier to work with because you don’t need to press
                the crescent roll perforations together. - Granulated sugar - Brown sugar - Ground cinnamon - Unsalted
                butter – you’ll want the butter and cream cheese softened prior to making the recipe, so I recommend
                removing them from the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before starting the recipe, so they can come up
                to room temperature. - Pazazz apples – I purchased the apples at Vons in my area, click here to find out
                where you can buy these sweet, tart and extra crispy apples in your area! - Cream cheese - Milk -
                Vanilla extract - Powdered sugar

        <div id="body2">
            <h3>1. Roll out the crescent roll dough. Place a large piece of parchment paper on a flat work surface.
                Place both sheets of crescent roll dough slightly overlapping on the parchment paper and press the seams
                together to form one large crescent roll rectangle.</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="body3">
            <h3>2. Top with the cinnamon sugar butter. In a medium bowl, combine softened butter with granulated sugar,
                brown sugar and ground cinnamon. Spread this mixture evenly across the crescent roll dough.</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="body4">
            <h3>3. Add the apples. Core and thinly slice one Pazazz apple, then place the slices on top of the cinnamon
                sugar butter in an even layer, not overlapping. Overlapping the apples will make it difficult to roll up
                and form into the wreath.</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="body5">
            <h3>4. Roll it up. Roll the crescent roll dough up tightly over the apples and the cinnamon sugar butter
                into a tube.</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="body6">
            <h3>5. Slice it in half. Use a sharp knife to slice lengthwise through the middle of the cinnamon roll tube.
            </h3>
        </div>
        <div id="body7">
            <h3>6. Separate the two halves. Once you’ve sliced the cinnamon roll tube in half, separate the two halves,
                and make sure the cinnamon butter and apples are facing up on both halves.</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="body8">
            <h3>7. Braid them together. Carefully braid the two halves together, lifting one half over the other, then
                vice versa until it’s rolled up into one long braid.</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="body9">
            <h3>8. Form the wreath. Bring the two ends of the braid together to form the wreath, then transfer the
                wreath on the parchment paper over to a baking sheet. Bake at 350°F for 20-25 minutes, or until the
                entire cinnamon roll wreath is golden brown.</h3>
